Objective: Create a fully functional chess game using Pygame that includes the following features:

Game Board:

Visually represent an 8x8 chess board in the Pygame window.
Player Turns:

Clearly indicate which player's turn it is (Player 1(white) or Player 2(black)).
Players should alternate turns when moving their pieces. 
Input Handling:

Detect mouse clicks on the squares to select and move pieces.
Prevent placing pieces on non-eligible squares.
Piece Movement:

Allow each piece to move according to standard chess rules.
Highlight possible moves when a piece is selected.
Check & Checkmate:

Detect when a player's king is in check.
Display a message if a player is put in check or checkmate.
Game Conditions:

End the game when a player wins and display the appropriate message.
Allow for draws (stalemate conditions).
Reset Option:

Provide an option to reset the game by pressing a key (e.g., 'R' for Reset).
Basic Graphics:

Use images same as that of real chess pieces to represent the different pieces and the board. 
Ensure the chess pieces have a professional and proper look, resembling polished, real chess pieces, enhancing the visual appeal to match a professional chess game.
Game Loop:

Implement a standard Pygame event loop for handling input, updating game state, and drawing.
AI Assistance:

Integrate a simple AI opponent that can play against the player.
Use VS Code's built-in AWS GUI for AI assistance.

Working Timer:
start the timer after the white moves for the first time
Implement a countdown timer of "3 minutes" for each player.
Include sound effects that play when the timer runs out or when a player makes a move.
Code Quality:

Prioritize clean, readable, and well-structured code.
Ensure all necessary Pygame imports are included, and the game is fully runnable.
Additional Considerations:
Ensure that the game handles edge cases, such as invalid moves and game resets.
Provide clear instructions or a help menu for new players.
Consider adding a settings menu for adjusting sound and graphics options.use this code and make a 3D INTERFACE of  chess model
